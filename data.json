Their vessel is controlled by HAL 9000, an artificially intelligent supercomputer capable of the highest level of cognitive functioning that rivals—and perhaps threatens—the human mind.",

This novel taps into a pretty pervasive phobia: clowns. Pennywise, the killer clown, dwells in the sewers of Derry, Maine, and he preys upon the young residents of the town by shapeshifting into their deepest fears. The group of kids (the so-called Losers Club) must band together to defeat him.",
